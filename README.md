# Netflix Clone (Front-End Only)

Welcome to the **Netflix Clone (Front-End Only)** project! This is a simple front-end replication of the Netflix homepage, designed for learning and practicing HTML and CSS. It focuses purely on the visual aspect of the Netflix landing page without any back-end functionality.
